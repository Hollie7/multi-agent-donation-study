# Multi-Agent Donation Persuasion System

This is a web-based chatbot platform designed to explore how **multi-agent** and **single-agent** systems with different **social identities** can influence users' willingness to **donate to charity**. The system integrates large language models (OpenAI GPT) and Firebase to simulate interactive conversations with agents of varying group affiliations (e.g., in-group vs. out-group).

## üß† Project Overview

- Supports both **single-agent** and **multi-agent** modes.
- Agents are designed with **social identity cues** to examine their influence on donation behaviors.
- Built with **React + Vite** frontend, powered by **OpenAI** for dialogue and **Firebase** for user data management.
